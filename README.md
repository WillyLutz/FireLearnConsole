# FireLearn Console v0.0.1

FireLearn Console (FLC) is a console-driven application developed by Willy Lutz that 
aims to provide an easy way to analyze multiple numerical data, such as electrical 
recordings. It uses the `fiiireflyyy` python library by the same author, to provide 
machine learning and other processing and analytical tools, without the need to write a single 
line of code. The only thing the user will be required to do is to modify the 
`.toml` configuration files to their needs. And of course the command line to start the application.

Everything the user needs to know will be explained thoroughly in this document.

# Installation and usage

No prior knowledge of console and command-line arguments is needed, although preferred. 
Everything will be explicit in this document. 

## Pre-requisites

To use this application, you will need to have Python 3.10 or more on your computer. Any older version will
not be tested for compatibility.


## Installation
You have two ways to install the application : installing via the git tool, or via downloading the zip file directly.
The second option is 
### Install via git
It is however needed to have `git` installed on your computer. You can get it on the official site 
[here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Once downloaded, install it on your system.

Once installed, open a terminal. You ca check the successful installation of git by writing
```console
git --version
```

It should print th installed version, such as `git version 2.34.1`.
