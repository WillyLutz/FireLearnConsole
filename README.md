# FireLearn Console v0.0.1

FireLearn Console (FLC) is a console-driven application developed by Willy Lutz that 
aims to provide an easy way to analyze multiple numerical data, such as electrical 
recordings. It uses the `fiiireflyyy` python library by the same author, to provide 
machine learning and other processing and analytical tools, without the need to write a single 
line of code. The only thing the user will be required to do is to modify the 
`.toml` configuration files to their needs. And of course the command line to start the application.

Everything the user needs to know will be explained thoroughly in this document.
